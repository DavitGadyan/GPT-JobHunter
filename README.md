# JobHunter

This module allows you to perform a job analysis on LinkedIn by searching for jobs using a given search term and location, extracting job descriptions from job URLs, and calculating the similarity between a given resume text and a job description.

## Installation
To use this module, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

`search_jobs`: a module for searching for jobs on LinkedIn

`extract_text_from_site`: a module for extracting text from a website

`text_similarity`: a module for calculating the similarity between two pieces of text

`time`: a module for adding delay between requests

`logging`: a module for generating log messages

`argparse`: a module for parsing command line arguments

`pprint`: a module for pretty-printing data structures

You will also need to subscribe to two RapidAPI APIs to use with the code and save your RapidAPI key as an environemnt variable called `API_KEY_RAPIDAPI`

## Usage
The main function of this module, jobs_analysis, takes a search term and a location as inputs and returns a list of dictionaries, each containing a job's title, url, description, and resume similarity score. The module also includes a main function that allows the user to input a search term and location through command line arguments.

To use this module, you will need to have a resume text file named 'resume.txt' in the same directory as the module. The function get_text_resume reads this file and returns the content as a single string.
