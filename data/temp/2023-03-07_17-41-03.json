OffWorld was founded by an experienced engineering team drawing on decades of tackling formidable engineering challenges at NASA, ESA,\u202fNOAA,\u202fMaxar\u202fTechnologies, CERN, Reaction Engines, SAFRAN, Surrey Satellites and Cisco.\u202fOffWorld\u2019s\u202ffirst challenge is developing and maturing a modular robotic system for\u202fextreme\u202fenvironments\u202fon Earth. Our\u202frobots will\u202fgo deeper underground and farthest on Earth than humans can,\u202feliminate the need for humans to work in life-threatening environments\u202fin mining, construction, tunneling and other dangerous\u202findustries,\u202fand dramatically reduce the environmental footprint and cost of\u202foperations\u202fin key economies on Earth and beyond. We have designed a modular robotic architecture that focuses on maximizing the commonality and reusability across components for fast deployment and optimization. Our robotic systems combine sensor information, cutting edge classical/machine learning (ML) algorithms and a robotics real-time system platform for control, decision making and execution. OffWorld is seeking an experienced and talented technical leader to become the Head of Robotics Software. You will lead a fast-moving team of talented robotics engineers working to create advanced robotics software and controls systems. You will manage and ensure technical excellence in domain expertise areas in controls, perception/SLAM. Path planning, computer vision, robotics simulation, Hardware-In-The-Loop and Software-In-The-Loop testing. Machine Learning algorithm integration experience is the field of robotics strongly sought out. A successful candidate must have strong theoretical and practical experience in several of the following areas: control theory, sensor fusion, filtering, arm positioning and control, forward and inverse kinematics, computer vision, ROS, motion planning and collision avoidance, SLAM and autonomous navigation. Experience in software project management is also required, including converting system-level requirements into software tasks, setting workplans and timelines, coordinating with team-members to track progress and meet target timelines.You will provide top level team and technical leadership helping grow subject matter expert teams in your group in the execution of multiple programs. Your work will be instrumental in the company's fast paced growth.
