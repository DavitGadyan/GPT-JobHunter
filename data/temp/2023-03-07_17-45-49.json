Using technology as a differentiator, Bliss Point Media brings modern statistical and computational techniques to bear on our clients' biggest marketing opportunities across linear TV and streaming/OTT video platforms. Our approach provides our clients with unique and powerful tools to maximize the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns while providing an experience of strategic depth and flawless execution. We work with some of the world's most recognizable new brands as well as established companies that want to rewrite their media playbook.This position is remote-optional. We are open to remote candidates located anywhere in the US. Bliss Point Media has offices in Santa Monica, Berkeley, and New York City.What you'll be doing:Bliss Point's clients are performance advertisers, which is to say they make investments with the expectation of a quantifiable return. Our job is to quantify those returns with maximal precision, and steward our clients' investments so as to make the return/investment ratio as attractive as possible.Bliss Point's approach to this challenge involves deploying a suite of algorithms that are both purpose-built and general purpose; that is, specifically designed for a given context, but broadly applicable to different advertisers operating within that context.Surrounding this core set of consistent, repeated questions, there are innumerable auxiliary questions: Should we test incrementality using an A/B audience holdout or a geographic holdout? How many impressions do we need to achieve statistical significance for our incrementality test, and how should those impressions be allocated between the control and exposed groups? What is the optimal frequency when we're running a promotion versus not? Are we better off ramping up media some time in advance of a promotion, or in a just-in-time fashion? When we ramp spend on TV, how much extra branded search spend should we budget for? Ad infinitum.This role will be auxiliary to the Client Strategy team, providing econometric support across the client base to bolster strategy and execution of campaign investments. In addition to analytical work, the role will have a significant interpersonal aspect: communicating methods and findings to clients, and contributing to the learning & development track for the client strategy team. The Econometrics Manager will report to the Director of Econometrics.We'd love to hear from you if:Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalized folks tend to only apply when they check every box.
