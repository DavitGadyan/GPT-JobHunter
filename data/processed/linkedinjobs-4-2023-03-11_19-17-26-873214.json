And as part of that, we\u2019re hiring a Director of Engineering Delivery. For more information about the company and the team, please check out our website.Quick FactsBefore we get into what the role looks like, here are a few quick facts about Hop Labs:100% remote, primarily based in the U.S.10-15 team members, depending on our project mix at any given timeExclusively focused on technical consulting around production-scale machine learningMultiple Fortune 10 clients, several Fortune 100 clients, and a long tail of funded startup clients Results-oriented work environment with a lot of flexibility -- we value life outside of workResponsibilitiesWe\u2019ve thought quite a bit about how to structure this role to align with our culture and business goals. We expect this team member to be responsible for ensuring that:Our team is doing its best work on behalf of our clients. Our clients are thrilled with the work Hop is doing on their behalf. Our clients\u2019 and team members\u2019 concerns are understood, and wherever appropriate, that their feedback is addressed. Our team members and clients are aligned on expectations. Our team\u2019s collective skillset and our team culture continues to improve in quality. Our hiring process is thoughtful, rigorous-yet-fair, and aligned with our cultural values. Day-to-DayHere\u2019s what we expect the day-to-day to look like for this role:Regular 1:1s with the technical delivery team members. We estimate this to be roughly a quarter of your time. Regular project syncs for active projects. We estimate this to roughly be another quarter of your time. Periodic 1:1s with key client stakeholders, to solicit feedback and deepen our client relationships.Periodic syncs with the sales/ops/HR sides of the business, to coordinate more broadly and stay aware of inbound projects or changes. Deeper team-member coaching (professional coaching, problem-solving, communication, etc.) and project oversight as specific acute issues emerge (and hopefully, are addressed). Positive SignsExecuting this role successfully would show up in these outcomes:Clients are happy with results and want to deepen their relationship with us. Our team members are engaged, and we have a good read on individual and team frustrations and are actively addressing them.Collectively, we are proud of the quality of our work across all projects. We have a principled and thoughtful approach regarding team roles, career paths and pay ranges, and our team supports those. We are resilient to individual team members taking time off or parting ways with us.This is a tall order, and meeting all of these points of success all of the time would be knocking it out of the park. We\u2019re already checking off about half of these at any given time, though inconsistently. We\u2019re looking for someone who will get us closer to the full list in a sustainable and consistent manner. We strongly believe that until we get there, we will not be able to responsibly grow the business, so this is a key hire that is critical for us to get right.Signs of ConcernIf any of the following were to occur, it might indicate to us that we'd need to reevaluate this role and our working relationship to make sure there's a successful path forward:Deliverables for clients are falling short of Hop\u2019s bar for quality and rigor. The expectation isn\u2019t that you would be responsible for the technical work \u2013 that would remain the responsibility of the technical team staffed on the project. Your responsibility would be to ensure that they have the resources, time and support to be able to do thoughtful, rigorous, high-quality work. Team members are frustrated or not engaged with the work they are doing. The expectation is that you would help to match project challenges to growth opportunities for individuals. Nobody expects every project to be fascinating, but our aim is that our team members are getting a healthy mix of projects they can knock out of the park and projects that help them grow. Clients are frustrated with Hop. The expectation is that you would be keeping a finger on the pulse of our client relationships, regularly soliciting feedback and identifying any potential misalignments between client expectations and the team\u2019s understanding for us to collectively resolve. Our hiring bar is slipping, and the folks we bring on aren\u2019t well aligned with the work we are doing. The expectation is that you would determine when we need to grow the size of the technical team and in what direction, and would drive (along with team-member participation) the hiring process for those roles. We already have a process that we\u2019ve put a lot of thought into but would welcome your ideas and vision for it. Our technical delivery team is not improving. The expectation is that this role will be keeping an eye out for opportunities to invest in the skills of the team, and to identify and develop best practices across projects that make us collectively more effective on every project. RequirementsWe\u2019re open to candidates of all backgrounds, but in prioritized order, these are qualities that we feel are particularly important for this role:Clear thinking and critical problem-solving Thoughtful and empathetic communication skills, and the ability to provide constructive and meaningful feedback Technical management background, ideally in the context of smaller companies Prior ownership over deliverables and timelines Consulting background Engineering background, though primarily what we\u2019re looking for here is someone who communicates well with engineers and can earn their respect. Less important is familiarity with any specific technical stack or machine learning \u2013 it sure would help, but is not required.Residency and authorization to work in the U.S. is required.We expect that annual compensation for this role will roughly fall in the $160 \u2014 200k range, though as this is a new role for our team, we\u2019re open to discussing compensation outside that range.BenefitsWe offer a full slate of benefits at Hop:Medical, dental and vision insurance with HSA optionMental health benefits Life and disability insurancePaid holidays and vacation timeFlexible work schedules\nShow more\nShow less\nSeniority level\nDirector\nEmployment type\nFull-time\nJob function\nManagement\nIndustries\nTechnology, Information and Internet\nReferrals increase your chances of interviewing at Hop Labs by 2x\nSee who you know\nGet notified about new Director of Engineering jobs in Atlanta, GA.\nSign in to create job alert\nLooking for a job?\nVisit the Career Advice Hub to see tips on interviewing and resume writing.\nView Career Advice Hub\nLinkedIn\n\u00a9 2023\nAbout\nAccessibility\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nYour California Privacy Choices\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Policy\nBrand Policy\nGuest Controls\nCommunity Guidelines\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 (Arabic)\n\u010ce\u0161tina (Czech)\nDansk (Danish)\nDeutsch (German)\nEnglish (English)\nEspa\u00f1ol (Spanish)\nFran\u00e7ais (French)\n\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 (Hindi)\nBahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)\nItaliano (Italian)\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e (Japanese)\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 (Korean)\nBahasa Malaysia (Malay)\nNederlands (Dutch)\nNorsk (Norwegian)\nPolski (Polish)\nPortugu\u00eas (Portuguese)\nRom\u00e2n\u0103 (Romanian)\n\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 (Russian)\nSvenska (Swedish)\n\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 (Thai)\nTagalog (Tagalog)\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e (Turkish)\n\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 (Ukrainian)\n\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 (Chinese (Simplified))\n\u6b63\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587 (Chinese (Traditional))\nLanguage\nCreate job alert\nGet email updates for new Director of Engineering jobs in Atlanta, GA\nDismiss\nBy creating this job alert, you agree to the LinkedIn User Agreement and Privacy Policy.
