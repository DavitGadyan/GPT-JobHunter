The existing ways to determine if somebody is who they claim to be are too clunky, ineffective, and expensive, but we believe strongly that the future will be 10x better.We\u2019ve had tremendous traction and are growing extremely quickly. Already our real-time APIs have helped verify hundreds of millions of identities, beginning with financial services. In 2021, we raised a $70M Series B round, led by Craft Ventures to rapidly scale our best in class products. We\u2019ve earned coverage and awards from TechCrunch, CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes, Business Insider, PYMNTS, American Banker, LendIt, and others. And we\u2019ve even been a part of history--we were the first company to go live with the eCBSV and testified before the United States House of Representatives .As the Director of Data Science at SentiLink, you will be responsible for machine learning model development and maintenance. You will lead a team of experienced data scientists in improving these products. You will work with risk operations, engineering, analytics, and product teams across the company to ensure full end-to-end quality of the models. Success will additionally be judged by growth of team capabilities.
