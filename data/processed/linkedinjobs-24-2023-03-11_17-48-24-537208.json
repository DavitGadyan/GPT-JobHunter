Are you sick of job descriptions that have that same opening line but fail to deliver? We are too. At Atomo, however, we follow through. We use machine learning to identify patients who have undiagnosed diseases so they can be identified, diagnosed and treated promptly.\u00a0Atomo is addressing the problem of undiagnosed disease head-on. We have developed a series of machine learning technologies that are trained on historical healthcare encounter data and learn to identify patients with certain medical conditions well before they are actually diagnosed. Not only is our solution highly marketable to multiple healthcare constituencies, but it also leads to patients getting the right diagnoses sooner and their physicians getting them the right treatment. Win-Win-Win.\u00a0Our work has been published in leading medical journals and we have recently been awarded a US Federal Grant from NIH to find undiagnosed patients in another medical condition.Our team is small but experienced and dedicated.\u00a0Amongst us are two PhDs (one from MIT and the other from UCLA), as well as veterans from the pharmaceutical industry and Healthcare IT Entrepreneurship.\u00a0We count some of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world as customers as well as research and advocacy organizations.\u00a0Additionally, we collaborate with several academic researchers out of Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, Geisinger Health System, and Ohio State. Atomo is profitable and continues to show steady revenue growth.We are looking for our next team member.\u00a0This is a full-time position, but for the right candidate, other arrangements are possible.\u00a0This person is smart, passionate, and an excellent data scientist.\u00a0They will help us improve our existing algorithms and innovate new solutions to new problems. And membership has its privileges. We have yet to take any outside funding, so in addition to a competitive salary our equity package will be more attractive than other small tech companies.\u00a0If you think this next team member is you, then we want to hear from you.\u00a0ResponsibilitiesApply data science and machine learning to healthcare encounter data as well as build upon and improve existing solutions.Work with our healthcare customers to incorporate domain-knowledge about the treatment of different diseases into our solutions.Work with our data engineering team on how to improve implementation of our technologyDevelop new solutions and implement them into production.RequirementsMasters or PhD in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Physics or a related quantitative fieldExperience with biostatistics will be an asset.Deep knowledge of machine learning and how to apply it to a wide range of problems.A proven track record of solving problems using machine learning in industry (i.e. beyond class projects), as well as implementing these solutions.Experience in dealing with large-scale datasets.Proficiency in data analysis and other tools such as Python, R, and Unix/Linux.Familiarity with medical claims or EHR data is a plus.\nShow more\nShow less\nEmployment type\nFull-time\nReferrals increase your chances of interviewing at Atomo, Inc by 2x\nSee who you know\nFeatured Benefits\nInferred from the description for this job\nMedical insurance\nDental insurance\nVision insurance\nGet notified about new Senior Data Scientist jobs in United States.\nSign in to create job alert\nLooking for a job?\nVisit the Career Advice Hub to see tips on interviewing and resume writing.\nView Career Advice Hub\nLinkedIn\n\u00a9 2023\nAbout\nAccessibility\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nYour California Privacy Choices\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Policy\nBrand Policy\nGuest Controls\nCommunity Guidelines\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 (Arabic)\n\u010ce\u0161tina (Czech)\nDansk (Danish)\nDeutsch (German)\nEnglish (English)\nEspa\u00f1ol (Spanish)\nFran\u00e7ais (French)\n\u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 (Hindi)\nBahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)\nItaliano (Italian)\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e (Japanese)\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 (Korean)\nBahasa Malaysia (Malay)\nNederlands (Dutch)\nNorsk (Norwegian)\nPolski (Polish)\nPortugu\u00eas (Portuguese)\nRom\u00e2n\u0103 (Romanian)\n\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 (Russian)\nSvenska (Swedish)\n\u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 (Thai)\nTagalog (Tagalog)\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e (Turkish)\n\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 (Ukrainian)\n\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 (Chinese (Simplified))\n\u6b63\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587 (Chinese (Traditional))\nLanguage\nCreate job alert\nGet email updates for new Senior Data Scientist jobs in United States\nDismiss\nBy creating this job alert, you agree to the LinkedIn User Agreement and Privacy Policy.
