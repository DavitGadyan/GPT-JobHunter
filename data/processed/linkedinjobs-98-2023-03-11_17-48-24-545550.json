Our code intelligence platform helps developers and companies with billions of lines of code create the software you use every day. By enabling more people to code, we believe we will create economic opportunity across the world and will drive progress that benefits everyone.It\u2019s an exciting time to join Sourcegraph. Our business is growing rapidly: we\u2019ve experienced exponential growth and our $125M Series D from Andreessen Horowitz and $50M Series C from Sequoia have given us the opportunity to make big ambitious bets on our future. We have a huge market (every company that builds software) and massive opportunity (most developers haven't even heard of code intelligence yet, but once you've used it, you can't live without it--just like Google). By continuing to hire exceptional people, we have the opportunity to make Sourcegraph one of the biggest technology companies in the world.Working hoursGiven that we are an all-remote company and hire almost anywhere in the world, we don\u2019t have a particular time-zone preference for this role. However, you may need to be available for non-recurring urgent meetings outside of working hours.Why this job is excitingWe are creating a machine learning team at Sourcegraph, aimed at creating the most powerful coding assistant in the world. Many companies are trying, but Sourcegraph has a unique advantage: Our rich code intelligence data and powerful code search platform. In the world of prompting LLMs, context is key, and Sourcegraph\u2019s context is simply the best you can get: IDE-quality, global-scale, and served lightning fast. Our code intelligence, married with modern AI, is already providing a remarkable alpha code-assistant experience. You can help us unlock its full potential, delivering a product that accelerates development in a way we only see every 10-15 years.To head up this effort, we are looking for a seasoned and deeply technical engineering leader, versed in programming language semantics, with a strong AI/ML background and familiarity with recent techniques, who can help us deliver the world\u2019s best coding assistant and ML-powered developer tooling, built on Sourcegraph\u2019s mature, robust, and open code intelligence platform. And if you happen to have an entrepreneurial streak, you\u2019re in luck: We have an enterprise distribution pipeline, so whatever you build can be deployed straight to enterprise customers with some of the largest codebases in the world, without all the go-to-market hassle you\u2019d encounter in a startup.Within one month, you will\u2026Start building a trusting relationship with your direct reports and peers.Come up to speed on the Sourcegraph product and platform, which are complex and mature.Be set up for local development and familiar with the coding assistant\u2019s basic architecture.Ship a substantial new feature to end users.Within three months, you will\u2026Help make the Beta launch as solid as possible.Finish hiring your world-class team.Be up to speed and driving Sourcegraph\u2019s AI strategy.Within six months, you will\u2026Have delivered a world-class coding assistant to a dozen big-name companies.Meet regularly with customers and prospects, representing the company.Have established a longer-term roadmap that keeps us aligned with expected advances in LLMs.About YouYou are a polyglot hacker in the AI/ML space who wants to build and lead a world-class team to push the boundaries of AI, with a particular focus on leveraging Sourcegraph\u2019s code intelligence to leapfrog competitors.First, you have a deep understanding of programming languages, and tools that manipulate code. This could have taken any number of forms; e.g.:You\u2019ve worked with grammars and parser generators, or TreesitterYou\u2019ve worked with compilers and semantic analysis, e.g. type systemsYou\u2019ve written an interpreter, or worked on a virtual machineYou\u2019ve done static analysis involving scanning source code for semantic informationIt doesn\u2019t really matter how you know it, but it\u2019s important that you\u2019re familiar with the basic concepts of semantic representations of source code, and how they\u2019re produced and consumed by tooling.Second, your AI background could look like a few different things:You\u2019ve worked on AI systems and have built ML at large tech companiesYou have a deep ML background and have demonstrated an ability to be customer and company focusedYou are hands-on and can build machine learningYou are a Prompt Engineer and can take models and figure out how to speak to it in a way that yields different resultsYou are an entrepreneurial engineer who can hack together prototypes quickly, get things out the door, and iterateYou are an LLM hacker or a thought leader in the LLM space and can craft a roadmap that takes advantage of the space, especially with code intelligenceYou\u2019ve worked in NLP or language models at a top-tier research labIf you\u2019ve been anywhere in the field lately, you can probably pick up enough about LLM capabilities to be able to drive this space, as it\u2019s all greenfield.Finally, you shouldn\u2019t be a purist about languages. We may need to integrate the coding assistant into a wide variety of tooling contexts, each with its own programming language. You may find yourself writing in several programming languages along the journey, and hopefully you already know most of them a little anyway.LevelThis job is an M4.
